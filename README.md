## Mapping Behavior to Brain Regions using Deep Learning 

## Summary
How do our brains control behavior? It has been a fascinating question that many biologists try to answer. 
In this project, I use deep learning techniques (i.e. 3D convolutional neural network (CNN)) to correlate 
behavioral outcomes with various brain scan images and map them to specific brain regions. It allows us to 
identify brain regions that regulate behavior.

# Project 2: Chan_project_R
## What make a good public school in Massachusetts

## Summary
The goal of this project is trying to use Massachusetts Public School data as an example, to provide fact-based, 
data-driven insights into discussions of public education. I will analyze various factors related to educators or students, 
and identify any potential elements that contribute to the successes of students. Based on these factors, I will generate 
machine learning models, to try to predict the outcome of education. It could give us some insights in public education policy.

## Version
R (v3.1.1)
